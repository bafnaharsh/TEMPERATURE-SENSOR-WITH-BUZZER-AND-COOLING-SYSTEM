Problem Statement


The Taliban are sitting on $1 trillion worth of minerals the world desperately needs. The
desperate Chinese government has locked a deal for lithium reserves in the Ghazni
province, Afghanistan. The Chinese have sent the necessary equipment but the Talibans are
unaware of the challenges faced while mining. The temperature conditions inside the mines
changes from time to time and it is advised for the miners not to stay inside the mines during
high temperatures.


Build a system that has the following functionalities:

1. A temperature indicating unit that indicates three following ranges of temperatures.
● <=30 degree Celsius
● >30 & <=40 degree Celsius
● >40 & <=50 degree Celsius

2. A cooling unit that switches on automatically at a temperature
3. An alerting unit that alerts the miners once the temperature crosses 50 degree
Celsius so the miners can come out safely.
